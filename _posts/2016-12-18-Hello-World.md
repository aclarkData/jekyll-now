As my first blog post, I thought I would begin by giving an overview of the broad range of topics that will be discussed on this blog: 

1. Economics, specifically the macroeconomic environment, game theory, and fiscal policy.
2. Financial markets, specifically the equity and bond markets.
3. Data Science, specifically the application of modern data science techniques in financial auditing.
4. Internal Audit, specifically audit risks, mitigation techniques, and the use of analytics to bring Internal Auditing into the 21st century. 
5. Discussions of the current business environment, competition and strategy.
6. Information technology, emerging technologies, and their use cases.
7. Book reviews and summaries across the topics outlined. 

The function of this blog will twofold: for the reader to learn new ideas or a different perspective on the topics outlined above and for me to solidify acquired knowledge. As I still have two semesters left in grad school, posts may not be regular at first, but will hopefully increase in frequency (and quality).

Until next time,

Andrew.
