Hello world! This is my first real blog post. I'm not new to the writing world, but I am new to the computer world. 

The software and computer industry was buzzing. Innovation and reimagination were everywhere and companies and individuals were on a mission: that each new day would mean more technological advancements, and that the role computers play in even the most simple of human tasks would be greater than the day before. As computers became more and more competent, through Machine Learning, AI, and who knows what other wizardry and magic, gradually, the world became more dependent on our mechanical little computer friends. But more and more, bit by bit, the human race was feeling like they didn't understand how the computers were functioning around them and weren't able to interact with them. They were feeling left behind. And then entered Alex. 

I have a passion for making difficult things appear simple, and believe that even the most complicated tasks can be broken down thoroughly into the most basic of fundamental building blocks. Everyone agrees that in the English language, the letter A comes before B, right? and D comes before E? Why can't it be the same way with technology? Well, it is. Whether it makes sense now or not, all your computer is doing is processing one task after the other in a sequence that makes sense to the computer, and also those who program them. In order for the computer equivalent of the letter B to occur, A has to happen first. Understanding how this works doesn't have to be complicated.

I am going to post tutorials and software documentation here. I hope it helps humans to understand their computer friends and be able to communicate with them.

Thanks for reading!
