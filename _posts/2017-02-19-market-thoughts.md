## Thoughts on the current market conditions and stock picks


A lot of people have been asking me about my stock tips on thoughts on the markets recently, so I’ve decided to right up my analysis as a blog post.


**Amazon** - AMZN

The future is Amazon. Amazon is on a path to practically world domination, and their founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos is a literal rock scientist (no joke, he owns Blue Origin, a private space company slated for the first human spaceflight in 2018). I’ve been telling everyone for the past 5 years or so to buy Amazon and it has continued to outperform.  Even though they have an extremely lofty price to earnings ratio of 120 or so, they are insanely profitable but plow all of their profits back into the business (which artificially inflates their ratio). Jeff Bezos is a visionary that thinks in terms of 50 year time periods instead of quarterly, like most companies, so he could care less about making investors happy with dividends or short term profits. Side note: be wary of companies that pay dividends. They should have a good reason for doing so, usually it is because they can’t find a way to invest their money back into the business, which means they’ve reached the top of their growth and my not be a good long-term investment.

Amazon owns the cloud computing infrastructure market, garnering an almost religious following among data engineers, software developers and data scientists. More and more of the world’s top businesses are migrating all of their IT systems there, so a very safe bet going forward. Netflix, for instance, has never had physical IT data centers. They have been completely cloud since day 1, way before it was popular. 


**Physical Gold** 

Since the market is nearing record highs, a market correction could occur at any time, tomorrow or in five years, it is impossible to predict. In the short term no one can really predict macroeconomic movements because the financial markets are a tightly woven complex system. However, we can predict microeconomic movements, hence way I’m so bullish on Amazon. However, since the next financial crash will most likely be the worst ever recorded, potentially shutting down markets, even banks, for months and the US Dollar losing it’s place as the world reserve currency to the IMF SDR, physical gold is an extremely import hedge to have. Note: before you say "why do you think banks and markets would shut down? That hasn't happened before!" Actually, it has happened before and the past 70 or so years of relative stability is the exception, not the rule. After WW1 broke out, for instance, US markets were closed for several months to prevent a mass sell off. 

I recommend putting around 10% of your assets in physical gold. I recommend a mixture of 1 oz up to 1 kilo gold bars, as they are closest to the real price of gold. However, it you would like to track the movement of gold without the burden of owning physical gold, although there is still a risk since it is a market fund, I suggest the SGOL exchanged traded fund. This fund holds physical gold in a Swiss vault and the shares that are traded are redeemable for the gold, if you have 50,000 shares or something, so really only readily redeemable for institutions. If you want a portfolio hedge to track gold movements, then this would be a good bet. Gold usually moves inverse to the general market, so it ‘hedges’ your risk.


The link below is to to Shiller's PE, a heuristic metric showing that we are nearing peak market valuation, again. This bubble has been caused by the Fed, primarily because it was acting politically to help Obama, but that is another story.

**Google** - GOOG

Lets face it, Google basically runs our lives. They know more about us than our families do (some of the information is wrong, but that is a different discussion). Since they have a near monopoly over online advertising and data collection, both of which are going to become more and more important, they are a good long-term bet. Although they are nearing their fair value, they are good for a buy and old. 

Google is the company that is on the forefront of all new AI, machine learning, etc technologies. They have the best minds in the world working on this stuff, spend billions a year, yes billions, on research. With this type of forethought and ‘moon shot’ projects, Google is an extremely good company to keep an eye on. 

**Berkshire Hathaway** - Warren Buffet’s baby - BRK.B (unless you can swing 250,000 for a class A share)

What can I say, Warren Buffet is the man. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, basically owns anything worth owning from the SP500 except technology. A very, very good long term hold (his successors are amazing and should be able to keep things going after he departs) with Berkshire being a diversified investment vehicle all by itself. Not incredibly attractive price wise at the moment, but as the Oracle of Omaha says “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” 

**Panera Bread** - PNRA

This pick barely made the list, but is worth mentioning. Panera has led the fast casual trend since it opened, and continues to be a trend setter. Recently switching to completely non-hormone meat and other natural ingredients, it should do very well going forward. They are priced very competitively at the moment, actually, and even though they are in a brutal industry, I’m confident in their ability to stay ahead of the pack. 


Hopefully these suggestions help you get started on your investing journey. If you made me rank these investments, I would say Amazon, physical gold, Berkshire, Google and then Panera in a distance fifth.
