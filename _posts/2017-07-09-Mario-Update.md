## Introducing Mario, An Internal Audit specific ETL and Data Mart solution.

In December, I wrote about a project I was starting, named Mario (https://aclarkdata.github.io/Introducing-Mario/). It has been a long process, but a MySQL database has been set up, and has began ingesting data to the production database as of July 1, 2017. I wrote a paper on the details and implementation specifics, which can be downloaded here:[MarioPaperFinal.pdf](http://aclarkData.github.io/papers/MarioPaperFinal.pdf). I will be submitting this paper to either the Journal of Information Systems or the 
International Journal of Auditing Technology, pending research over on which journal it would better serve. For more information or specifics that were not addressed in the paper, feel free to send me an email. Enjoy!
