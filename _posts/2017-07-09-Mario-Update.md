## Introducing Mario, An Internal Audit specific ETL and Data Mart solution.

In December, I wrote about a project I was starting, code named [Mario](https://aclarkdata.github.io/Introducing-Mario/). It has been a long process, but a MySQL database has been set up, and has began ingesting data to the production database as of July 1, 2017. I wrote a paper on the details and implementation specifics, which can be downloaded [here](http://aclarkData.github.io/papers/MarioPaperFinal.pdf). I am planning on submitting this paper to a journal, but it is yet to be determined which one . For more information or specifics that were not addressed in the paper, feel free to send me an email. Enjoy!

P.S. I have added a newsletter to this blog, which will send out an email whenever a new post is added. Move over to the [About](https://aclarkdata.github.io/about/) page if you would like to subscribe.
