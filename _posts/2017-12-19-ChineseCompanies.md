## Chinese Companies and current market thoughts

For geopolitical and macroeconomic reasons, I’m bearish on Chinese companies because of three main factors: Xi Jinping and demographics and debt.
 
* Xi Jinping is becoming the new “Mao” of China: consolidating power and subjugating every activity under the State. He has recently come down hard on Chinese capitalism, letting large companies, such as Alibaba, operate relatively unscathed, as long as they stay subservient to the State(http://fortune.com/2017/08/14/china-targets-tencent-alibaba-and-baidu-with-new-regulation/https://www.wsj.com/articles/wechat-weibo-among-targets-in-china-cybersecurity-probe-1502432081). Recent crackdowns on influential capitalists show that Xi means business (http://fortune.com/2017/08/03/xi-jinping-new-starting-point-for-china/). This is a huge factor, and my biggest concern with Chinese companies.
 
* China is facing a huge crisis with regards to demographics, a key factor being their “successful” one child policy they initiated in the 1979. The labor market is shrinking annually for the foreseeable future so with more citizens on the government pension, this will create some friction on growth (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15151.pdf).
 
* China’s immense ride to power had been debt fueled and cracks are beginning to show in the edifice(http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/25/news/economy/china-debt-economy/index.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/china-debt-levels-stability-risk-imf). To keep up growth, China has constructed many ‘ghost cities’(http://www.businessinsider.com/these-chinese-cities-are-ghost-towns-2017-4) where few if any people live, but have created artificial growth. Until China transforms into a consumer economy, there will be serious headwinds for sustained growth. 
 
There are some bright spots, however, such as China’s goal to become an AI powerhouse(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html) however they will face an uphill battle with the best and brightest leaving the ship.
 
 
Some of my current US portfolio favorites: 
 
* Gold: Because of the recent bubble around cryptocurrencies, Gold has taken a hit in valuation. Regardless of the recent dip, which indicates a decent entry point, this ‘barbaric relic’ is a fantastic investment, when in physical form, works for easily up to 10% of assets. Due to instabilities in the USD and its most likely obliteration in the next financial crisis (the Fed was actually insolvent for a while during the past couple years if they were required to do real accounting). Gold is a wonderful hedge against uncertainty and is a true store of value. Gold doesn’t actually change value, currencies float around gold based on their strength. Something interesting to think about.  
 
* Berkshire Hathaway class A: When it comes to investing, ‘unsexy’ is usually the smartest move. Berkshire Hathaway focuses on long-term competitive advantage cash cow companies. I think of it as a better S&P 500. It is so wide and diverse, the only thing it has in common with itself is solid companies that generate reliable profits. It will not significantly outperform the S&P 500, but will by a few percentage points with a lot less risk. 
 
* Amazon: Amazon is on track to take over the world. With an ever-expanding roster of capabilities, its tentacles are spreading into more and more of everyday life. As long as Jeff Bezos is at the helm, this company is unstoppable. Although there is a lot of competition in the cloud computing space, Amazon is the true leader, with the most stability, scalability and customizability. Also, as the major first mover, they are in a good position to capture a large section of this highly competitive market. They are a little pricy at the moment, but are always a good buy (I would recommend waiting for some sort of dip before buying in). One of the key reasons for their success has been they don’t play with Wall street, Bezos thinks long-term and doesn’t worry about the short-termism that plagues basically every other publicly traded company. 
 
* Google: Alphabet Inc. Class A shares are a great buy, maybe slightly frothy, but not as much as Amazon. If there is another company that is taking over the world, it is Google. Google is a cash cow with its advertising business, so much so, it can experiment in many different areas (which is one of the reasons of its recent restructuring from Google to Alphabet, to better separate business units for financial reporting). One of Alphabet’s subsidiaries, Waymo, is currently the world leader in the extremely competitive autonomous vehicle market with test cars on roads of several US cities (https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16615290/waymo-self-driving-safety-driver-chandler-autonomous). Google has many of the top researchers in Computer Science and related disciplines, so for any new developments in tech, which seem to be driving the stock market, they will be leaders in it. 
 
One important consideration when investing with tech companies, is that any portfolio with Google or Amazon (or another tech company) needs to have them balancing out the top of the pyramid, with “real” tangible companies still making up a larger percentage. Despite current market and popular culture gyrations, high tech is not an end to itself, and is just a tool to improve existing processes. There is a bubble in a lot of tech at the moment, with inflated expectations, so at some point, there will be a degree of a correction.
