I've been doing some thinking lately about the failures of modern economics, specifically Federal Reserve Policy, and read an article [Economists versus the Economy](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/mathematical-economics-training-too-narrow-by-robert-skidelsky-2016-12?utm_source=project-syndicate.org&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=authnote) that highlights something I have noticed implicitly in my studies: many of the world's most revolutionary economists (Smith, Keynes, Hayek, Nash, Tinbergen, Rickards, etc.) did not have extensive _formal_ training in economics. Economics, as it is taught today, focuses on breaking down the economy into simplified models (linear and stochastic) that are solved for equilibrium using rigorous mathematics, think optimization, derivatives, etc. while intuition on the economy's dynamic, complex, and behavioral elements is downplayed, if taught at all. True economic, specifically macroeconomic, study involves many facets with traditional economics only being a subset. Equally important are behavior psychology, network theory, complexity theory, geopolitical game theory, and Bayesian statistics, to name a few. A very broad style of thinking that encompasses numerous disparate fields allows the individual to see connections that are not possible when applying only traditional, 'toyish' interpretations of the economy cannot provide. It should be noted that many economists know these models are wrong, but for some reason keep using them. As to not to elongate this post or digress into the problems associated with academic economics that is precluding innovation, we shall conclude
