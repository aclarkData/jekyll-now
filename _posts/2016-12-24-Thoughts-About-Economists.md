I've been doing some thinking lately about the failures of modern economics, specifically Federal Reserve Policy, and read an article [Economists versus the Economy](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/mathematical-economics-training-too-narrow-by-robert-skidelsky-2016-12?utm_source=project-syndicate.org&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=authnote) that highlights something I have noticed implicitly in my studies: some of the world's most successful economists did not have formal training in economics. Economics, as it is taught today, focuses on breaking down the economy into simplified models that are solved for equilibrium using rigirous mathematics, think optimization, derivatives, etc. while the intentiution on the econmomies dynamic, complex, and behvaioral elemtns is downplayed, if taught at all.
