## ISACA North America CACS 2017

Next month I will be presenting two presentations entitled: 'Where Open Source Meets Audit Analytics' and 'Machine Learning for Auditors: What you need to know' at the ISACA North America CACS conference in Las Vegas. As the premier conference for IT Audit, IT Security and IT Governance professionals, I am very excited and honored to have the opportunity to present. In the lead-up to this event, I have had the opportunity to write a short article for CIO Insight, the self proclaimed "...voice of the CIO community, providing perspectives and analysis from top IT leaders and industry experts..." Links to the presentation slides and article are linked below. If you happen to be attending NACACS, stop by and say hi!

As always, let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.
