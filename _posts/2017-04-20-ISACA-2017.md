## ISACA North America CACS 2017

Next month I will be presenting two presentations entitled: 'Where Open Source Meets Audit Analytics' and 'Machine Learning for Auditors: What you need to know' at the ISACA North AmericaCACS conference in Las Vegas. As the premier conference for IT Audit, IT Security and IT Governance, I am very excited to have the opportunity to present. In the leadup to this event, I had the opportunity to write a short article for CIO Insight, self proclaimed "...voice of the CIO community, providing perspectives and analysis from top IT leaders and industry experts to help CIOs think more strategically, identify and solve key problems, and maximize their business leadership skills." Links to the presentation slides and article are linked below. Hopefully, they can provide some value. 

As always, let me know if you have any questions or ideas.
