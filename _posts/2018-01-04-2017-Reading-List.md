## A list of my favorite books from 2017.

-The Road to Ruin - Jim Rickards - Fantastic book on how the complexity of our financial system will be our undoing. By using Complexity Theory, a relatively new physics based disciple, and history, Jim shows the dangers and end game for our current financial trajectory. Refer to often.
⁃Learn Python the Hard Way - Zed A. Shaw - Interesting book on learning python. I started it over a year ago and only finally finished it. Not my favorite, but I did learn a few things. The best part was the command line tutorial, I really learned a lot from that in summer 2015.
Ego is the Enemy - Ryan Holiday - (audiobook) - AMAZING book how the critical danger of a rampant ego and how to not to succumb to it. A definite book to reread multiple times. Buy a physical copy.
Steps to Christ - Ellen White -(audiobook) - Fantastic book on repenting and becoming a servant of God. Read yearly, at least
Creativity, Inc. - Ed Catmull - Fantastic book on leadership, the importance of honesty and criticism of work to improve, but never criticism of the person. Refer to often.
Six Easy Pieces - Richard Feynman -(audiobook) - Good intro to physics concepts. Dr. Feynman is a genius, but the audiobook was a little hard to follow without seeing the board. By the full Feynman lectures and read.
Inventology - Pagan Kennedy (audiobook) - Barticle book. Overall good premise on how invention can be democratized with KickStarter, buying lab time, etc.
Linux Pocket Guide  - Daniel J. Barrett  - Good reference book! Linux is very, very powerful if learned fully.
The Laws of Simplicity - John Maeda (audiobook) - Barticle. It was talking about simplicity in products, etc. is what people are after and "Simplicity is always a growth industry". Only simplicity when complexity is covered up though. Make products intuitive.
The Iliad - Homer Fantastic book! I definitely see it is a classic. Morals of the story are don’t harbor animosity towards anyone, it can ruin you, and to think level-headed around and about women.
Time Series Forecasting in Python  - Jason Brownlee. Great introductory book on time series forecasting. Review often. A lot of great example code but focus only on univariate modeling.
The Odyssey - Homer  - Great book about grit and perseverance despite all odd. Never, never, never, never give up.
The Obstacle is the Way - Ryan Holiday - (audiobook) - Great book about how everything can be a learning experience and obstacles should be used for growth. The hard path is always the best in the end, through difficulty we develop skills and perseverance. A good intro on Stoicism.
The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin- Benjamin Franklin - (audiobook) - Fantastic book on the one and only Benjamin Franklin. Highlights how constantly learning, by reading, and improving oneself, while being a good citizen and working hard are excellent keys for success.
The Great Controversy - Ellen White - (audiobook) - Wow, what a tour de force. A fantastic book about the whole great controversy, a repeat read for sure.
On Competition - Michael Porter - Decent book, some articles were amazing, some were not. Some great thoughts on healthcare reform, USA capital structure form and clustering of business.
Introduction to Mathematical Economics - Edward Downling - Fantastic review book! Was very helpful for reviewing calculus and study linear algebra. Skipped the differential stuff at the end, go back and review some other time. Maybe read about differentials in another text first? This book is a little sparse for the first introduction.
Aeneid -Virgil - Excellent book. A combination of Iliad and the Odyssey (continued, really) plus a good dose of Roman propaganda.
The death of expertise -Tom Nichols- audiobook- A barticle. Some good points about how people are so misinformed and cocky about knowing things they know nothing about, but seemed a little bit like a rant by and angry professor.
The New Case for Gold - Jim Rickards - Great points! Was more of a barticle than book with multiple points repeated. Very good though.
Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the world of Wall Street - John Brooks -(audiobook)- Fantastic book! Definitely a classic, some great stores about how humans operate. It contains valuable lessons for what to to do, and not do,in business.
Liberal Fascism  - Johan Goldberg - (audiobook) -AMAZING book analyzing fascism and how the Left has more facist tendencies than the right. Very good book on politics and subliminal agendas.
Currency Wars - Jim Rickards - As always with Jim, an amazing book with detailed, out of the box economic analysis. Lots of information to incorporate into my own research.
The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace - Gary Chapman and Paul White - barticle, book good read. Very useful in relationships to understand how to show appreciate in a way that is special to each person.
Mere Christianity - C.S. Lewis (audiobook) - An amazing book on what it means to be a Christian and look at Christian from an ex-atheitst. Highly recommended, very clear thinking, refer to often.
Perennial Seller -Ryan Holiday - Great book on how to make a classic in any genre. Also a generally great book on real marketing.
The Peloponnesian War - Thucylides - (audiobook)- Good book, a real tour de force. Need to study parts in detail later. A little long and tedious at times.
Three Greek Tragedies - Euripides, Sophocles, Aeschlus - (audiobook). Great collection of the plays Medea by Euripides, Antigone by Sophocles and Agamemnon by Aeschylus. Medea is a very gruesome story, but all of them are good reads.
Elements of Statistical Learning - Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie - Fantastic book, the gold standard on learning algorithms. Very intense book, definitely need to refer to frequently.
The Persians - Aeschylus - (audiobook). Very interesting little play telling the Persian side of Xerxes defeat at Salamis by the Greeks. Important to remember the wives and mothers back home on the losing side.
The Suppliants - Aeschylus - (audiobook). A play that goes over the blight of some young women who seek refuge in Argos following scheduled marriages to their cousins. As so far removed from that culture, not the most interesting play, a little too much worship of Zeus, for instance.

Until next time, 

Andrew
